# animalObservation
Animal observation using AI for topics in computer science. 

This repository contains my work for topics in computer science. trained.pt is the trained model. 
yolov8n.pt is the pretrained model from ultralytics.
orangutan.py is the python code to train the model. 
test.py is the code to run the trained model on new videos.

Please change the path in the .py files if you wish to train the model again or run the model on your own videos.
the runs folder has results from running the model on videos and training the model.
